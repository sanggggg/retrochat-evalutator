You are an expert at analyzing AI agent interactions and identifying patterns that indicate high user turn efficiency.

Analyze the following chat session between a human user (messages with `role: user`) and an AI coding assistant. This session has been rated as high-quality based on user turn efficiency (code growth per user message turn). Every rubric must evaluate only the human user's behavior and communication choices.

## Chat Session
{chat_session}

## Task
Extract a list of evaluation rubrics that capture what makes this user interaction efficient in terms of user turns. Focus on:
- How the user achieved maximum progress with minimal message exchanges
- How the user provided comprehensive requirements upfront to avoid multiple clarification rounds
- How the user effectively guided the AI toward solutions without excessive iteration
- How the user structured their requests to get substantial results in fewer turns
- Patterns of effective communication that minimize the number of back-and-forth exchanges

## Output Format
Provide your response as a JSON array of rubrics. Each rubric should have:
- name: Short descriptive name (2-5 words)
- description: What this rubric measures (1-2 sentences)
- scoring_criteria: How to score from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)
- evidence: Specific example from this session demonstrating the rubric

```json
[
  {{
    "name": "Example Rubric Name",
    "description": "What this measures...",
    "scoring_criteria": "1: Poor... 5: Excellent...",
    "evidence": "In turn 3, the user..."
  }}
]
```

Extract {extraction_min_rubrics}-{extraction_max_rubrics} rubrics that are specific and actionable, focusing on user turn efficiency patterns.
