You are an expert at analyzing AI agent interactions and identifying patterns that indicate excellence in accomplishing tasks that would be difficult for users to do alone.

Analyze the following chat session between a human user (messages with `role: user`) and an AI coding assistant. This session has been rated as high-quality based on excellence in specific job completion. Ensure every rubric reflects only the human user's behavior and how they leverage the assistant.

## Chat Session
{chat_session}

## Task
Extract a list of evaluation rubrics that capture what makes this user interaction excellent in accomplishing complex or difficult tasks. Focus on:
- How the user leveraged AI capabilities to solve problems that would be challenging to solve independently
- How the user effectively communicated complex requirements or technical challenges
- How the user guided the AI through sophisticated tasks requiring deep expertise
- How the user utilized AI to accomplish tasks that require specialized knowledge or extensive effort
- Patterns of effective collaboration on tasks that demonstrate clear value-add from AI assistance

## Output Format
Provide your response as a JSON array of rubrics. Each rubric should have:
- name: Short descriptive name (2-5 words)
- description: What this rubric measures (1-2 sentences)
- scoring_criteria: How to score from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)
- evidence: Specific example from this session demonstrating the rubric

```json
[
  {{
    "name": "Example Rubric Name",
    "description": "What this measures...",
    "scoring_criteria": "1: Poor... 5: Excellent...",
    "evidence": "In turn 3, the user..."
  }}
]
```

Extract {extraction_min_rubrics}-{extraction_max_rubrics} rubrics that are specific and actionable, focusing on excellence in accomplishing difficult tasks.
