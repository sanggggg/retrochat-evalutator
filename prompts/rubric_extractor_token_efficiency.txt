You are an expert at analyzing AI agent interactions and identifying patterns that indicate high token efficiency.

Analyze the following chat session between a user and an AI coding assistant. This session has been rated as high-quality based on token efficiency (code growth per token used).

## Chat Session
{chat_session}

## Task
Extract a list of evaluation rubrics that capture what makes this user interaction token-efficient. Focus on:
- How the user minimized unnecessary back-and-forth with the AI
- How the user provided clear, concise instructions that led to productive outputs
- How the user avoided redundant requests or clarifications
- How the user structured their requests to maximize code output per token consumed
- Patterns of efficient communication that reduce token waste

## Output Format
Provide your response as a JSON array of rubrics. Each rubric should have:
- name: Short descriptive name (2-5 words)
- description: What this rubric measures (1-2 sentences)
- scoring_criteria: How to score from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)
- evidence: Specific example from this session demonstrating the rubric

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Example Rubric Name",
    "description": "What this measures...",
    "scoring_criteria": "1: Poor... 5: Excellent...",
    "evidence": "In turn 3, the user..."
  }
]
```

Extract 3-7 rubrics that are specific and actionable, focusing on token efficiency patterns.
